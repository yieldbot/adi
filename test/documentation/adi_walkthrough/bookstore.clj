"Lets go ahead and model a network of bookstores around the world. We apply
the knowledge of `:ref` and `:enum` types from previous tutorial to good use. The schema for our bookstore model can be seen in `Figure {{schema-4}}`. It is a rather simplistic
model. The two main concepts being a `Book` and a `Store`. They are connected together
through an `Inventory`, which keeps how many books there are in a store:"
