We forked this because Chris decided to rename ADI to spirit and take the project in a significantly different direction. Since time-room is very dependent on ADI and it's current behavior we need this to remain consistant with the current ADI version.

[adi](https://www.github.com/zcaudate/adi) provides a simple, intuitive data layer to access datomic using a document-based syntax, as well as a data-processing pipeline for fine-grain manipulation and access of data.

Please see the [main website](http://docs.caudate.me/adi) for more details.
