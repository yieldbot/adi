"[spirit](https://www.github.com/zcaudate/spirit) makes working with data easy. As a result, [spirit](https://www.github.com/zcaudate/spirit) makes creating complex applications easy. Created around [datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) by enabling simplification of its API, spirit was especially designed to model data and the complexities around relationships.

The key to understanding any application lies with understanding how data flows through the system. Therefore, the database schema is central to any complex piece of software. [spirit](https://www.github.com/zcaudate/spirit) takes this one step further by capturing not only the schema, but also how data is transformed between different datastores. In this way, a common thread is established between all stores of data (document database, relational database, document search) within an application, reducing complexity and mental load through having a single source of truth."
