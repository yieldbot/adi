"adi makes creating complex applications easy.
As an extension on top of datomic, adi was especially designed to model data, relationships and their complexities.
 
So what is adi?
 
   - Document and graph hybrid database.
   - Conversion of relational data to maps and vice-versa
   - Data-centric, declarative CRUD
   - Schema driven validation and processing.
   - Intuitive, simple, expressive.
 
The key to adi lies the power of the schema. Instead of limiting the programmer, the schema should exhance him/her, much like what a type system does for programmers but without being as restrictive. adi allows for relationships in data to be expressed as schema and then provides methods for smarter, more declarative control over data access."
